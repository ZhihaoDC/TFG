This is a repository created to keep track of changes in the code for my degree's final thesis.

## marvel-vs-dc [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZhihaoDC/TFG/blob/main/source/marvel-vs-dc.ipynb)
  A short notebook using the marvel-vs-dc.csv dataset, which contains the names of Marvel and DC movies and their respective release date, rate and earnings. 
  The notebook tries to represent these movies as an unweighted undirected graph, in order to see the communities that describe such graph.
  The method used to achieve this goal is the Girvan-Newman algorithm, implemented in the Networkx python package.
  
  

## marvel-social-network (Girvan-Newman Algorithm) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZhihaoDC/TFG/blob/main/marvel_social_network.ipynb)
  A notebook that implements the Girvan-Newman algorithm for the graph contained in the marvel-social-network.csv dataset.
  Networkx.Graph representation is used, but functionality of the Girvan-Newman algorithm is fully implemented.
  
  
  
## marvel-social-network-Louvain (Louvain Algorithm)
  A notebook that implements the Louvain Algorithm for the graph contained in the marvel-social-network.csv dataset.
  Networkx.Graph representation is used, but functionality of the Louvain algorithm is fully implemented.
